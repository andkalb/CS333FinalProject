### Truth Table Generator

This is a project I (Andrew Kalb) originally developed in C++ a few years ago which I decided to remake for my CS333 Final Project.

Basically, you can enter any boolean algebra expression and the program will return the truth table result.

The project includes
- A bunch of unit tests (95% coverage from the Test files)
- 5 Integration tests (marked with comments mentioning "integration"
- An automated workflow to run the unit tests with unittest
- An automated workflow to build the project into a windows executable, tag, and create a release for that tag on GitHub
